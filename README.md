"McNameeChess.cpp" is my main()
"chess.cpp" is the class definition file
"chess.h" is my chess class header file
"chessboards.txt" is what is being read in,
Basically my program reads in chessboards.txt, 
then tallys up how much each person scored and reprints the board to look neater, 
and have a cool text output.

FIRST GITHUB PROGRAM!
